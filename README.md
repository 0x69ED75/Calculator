# Calculator
### A basic calculator I have made to learn JavaFX and to try and use some OOP.

Currently supports the following for positive, negative and decimal point integers:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Square root 
* Conversions between Hex, Decimal, Octal and Binary. (Currently only accurate for whole, positive numbers)

Furthermore, error handling is included where possible.

## TODO list:
I would now consider this feature-complete, however, I would like to rewrite some aspects of the application to move away from static variables and use more OOP techniques.
