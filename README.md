# Calculator
A basic calculator I have made to learn JavaFX and to try and use some OOP.

- Currently only supports: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of both whole and decimal numbers.

TODO list:
- Add error handling
- Improve object oriented-ness
- Improve "Operators" class where the mathematics takes place, as currently I am not happy with how everything is calculated, although, it will work for now.
