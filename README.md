# Calculator
A basic calculator I have made to learn JavaFX and to try and use some OOP.

- Currently only supports simple addition and subtraction.

TODO list:
- Add division and multiplication
- Add error handling
- Improve object oriented-ness
- Improve "Operators" class where the mathematics takes place, as currently I am not happy with how everything is calculated, although, it will work for now.
