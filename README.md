# Calculator
### A basic calculator I have made to learn JavaFX and to try and use some OOP.

Currently supports the following for positive, negative and decimal point integers:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Square root 
* Binary Conversion (currently only for whole positive Integers)

Furthermore, error handling is included where possible.

TODO list:
- Include more conversions
- Improve object oriented-ness
