# Calculator
A basic calculator I have made to learn JavaFX and to try and use some OOP.

- Currently only supports: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of both whole and decimal numbers, as well as negative numbers.

TODO list:
- Add error handling - 25% complete.
- Improve object oriented-ness
- Improve "Operators" class, it is an exponential growing mess with every feature added.
